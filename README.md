# üìúScript Install Docker and Docker-Compose (Debian/Debian-based)
This script is a Bash script that aims to install **Docker** and **Docker Compose** in their latest versions on an Debian/Debian-based system.

The goal is to provide a single command that can perform a clean and quick installation of these two tools. After the installation, the git folder is deleted.

The script is compatible with Debian and other versions based on Debian.

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikaPST/script-install-docker-dockercompose/main/install_docker.sh | sudo bash
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Prerequisites:
1. Any hardware or vps/vds server running Linux. You should have administrative rights on this machine.
2. The machine must have internet access


# üîé Detailed Description of the Script 

## 1 - The first part of the script
Checks if the necessary dependencies are installed, namely the lsb_release command. If it is not installed, the script displays a message to the user indicating that the lsb-release package is not installed and proceeds to install it using the apt-get command.

## 2- The second part of the script
Updates the distribution using the apt-get update command followed by the apt-get -y dist-upgrade command. Then, the script executes the apt-get -y autoremove --purge and apt-get autoclean commands to remove old packages and unnecessary files.

## 3 - The third part of the script
Uninstalls old versions of Docker using the apt-get remove command.

## 4 - The fourth part of the script
Installs the necessary dependencies for Docker, namely the ca-certificates, curl, and gnupg packages, using the apt-get install command.

## 5 - The fifth part of the script
Sets environment variables for sensitive information. These variables contain the necessary information to add the official Docker repository, such as the GPG key and the repository URL.

## 6 - The sixth part of the script
Adds the GPG key of the official Docker repository by downloading the key from the URL defined earlier and adding it to the /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg directory. This part of the script also configures the Docker repository by adding a new line to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list file.

## 7 - The seventh part of the script
Installs Docker using the apt-get install command by adding the docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, docker-buildx-plugin, and docker-compose-plugin packages.

## 8 - The eighth part of the script
Checks if Docker is running using the systemctl is-active --quiet docker command. If Docker is not running, the script displays a message to the user.

## 9 - The ninth part of the script
Shecks if Docker has been successfully installed using the docker --version | grep -q "Docker version" command. If Docker has not been successfully installed, the script displays a message to the user.

## 10 - The last part of the script
Downloads and installs the latest version of Docker Compose using the curl command. Then, the script modifies the permissions of the docker-compose file to make it executable. Finally, the script displays a message to the user indicating that Docker Compose has been successfully installed.
